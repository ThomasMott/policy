    <h1>Privacy Policy for Item Tracker App</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: March 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Item Tracker App ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by our app when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>
    <p>Our App is designed to help you track and list items you own, without requiring accounts or collecting analytics data. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.</p>

        <li>Require user accounts or login credentials</li>
        <li>Collect location data</li>
        <li>Use analytics tools to track user behavior</li>
        <li>Use advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Access your contacts, camera, or microphone (unless explicitly granted permission to add photos of items)</li>
        <li>Share or sell any information to third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into the app (including item descriptions, photos, and tracking information) is stored locally on your device only. This data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Storage access: To save and load your item database on your device</li>
        <li>Camera access: Only if you choose to take photos of your items (optional)</li>
        <li>Photo library access: Only if you choose to select existing photos of your items (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
